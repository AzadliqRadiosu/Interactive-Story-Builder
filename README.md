# JumpStart Georgia's Story Builder

## Summary
Story Builder is a web application that allows users to build mixed-media stories that can then be shared with the world. You can try Story Builder out for yourself on our [test site](http://dev-storybuilder.jumpstart.ge/en).

The idea for this application came after viewing this [New York Times story](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/10/27/south-china-sea/). We wanted to be able to create stories like this without having to start from scratch for every story.  We wanted to be able to quickly put interactive, mixed-media stories together without having to require a lot of designer or developer time.  That is the goal of this application.


## How It Works
Story Builder is similar to a blog editor like wordpress or tumblr, but at this point is still a little rustic.  In essence, Story Builder allows you to add content, images, and/or videos into sections in a story that can be ordered however you want.

Right now there are two types of sections that can be created: Content and Full-Screen Media.
* Content: Simple text with a rich-text editor like Word of Google Docs.
* Full-Screen Media: This can be a combination of images and/or videos that will appear on the screen in a vertical slider format, one after the other.  The media is stretched to fill the users entire window and a small caption text can appear ontop of the media.

Aside from entering the story into the sections, you also have the ability to:
* re-arrange the sections in the story
* clone a story as the beginning of a new story
* export a story so you can host it on any website
