# JumpStart Georgia's Story Builder

## Summary
Story Builder is a web application that allows users to build mixed-media stories that can then be shared with the world. 

The idea for this application came after viewing this [New York Times story](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/10/27/south-china-sea/). We wanted to be able to create stories like this but without having to start from scratch for every story.
